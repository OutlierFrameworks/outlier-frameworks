# Outlier Frameworks

**Outlier Frameworks** provides playbooks, mindset shifts, and step‑by‑step systems for entrepreneurs and professionals who succeed unconventionally. We built wealth without privilege or shortcuts, escaping the 9‑5 grind and proving doubters wrong. Now we share the frameworks we wish we had: covering finance, lending, investing, compliance, and business strategy.

## Mission
- **Demystify the system**: Turn complex laws, banking codes, and regulatory frameworks into clear, actionable guides.
- **Empower underdogs**: Give underestimated entrepreneurs the tools and confidence to build lasting wealth.
- **Share real playbooks**: Every article, download, and resource is based on lived execution—not recycled theory.

## About Us
We weren’t born with a silver spoon. We climbed out of debt, reached a six‑figure net income in the first year (after tax), and built a life on our own terms. Outlier Frameworks is where we share the exact steps we took: from structuring deals and navigating compliance to investing smartly and scaling businesses.

If you’ve ever been told you don’t fit the mold—you’re one of us. **Outliers build empires.**
